# About this Workshop {.unnumbered}

This course will provide an overview of new techniques to estimate metabolic processes in estuaries using new software with the R open-source programming language. We will describe the theory and application of the new Estuarine BAyesian Single-station Estimation (EBASE) method that applies a Bayesian framework to a simple process-based model and dissolved oxygen observations, allowing the estimation of critical metabolic parameters as informed by a set of prior distributions.  We will also explore how EBASE and additional R features can be used to evaluate metabolism results and to identify potential drivers of change.  By the end of the course, you will understand how to prepare data for use with EBASE and to interpret the results to better understand processes that influence ecosystem status and condition. Basic R experience is expected.
