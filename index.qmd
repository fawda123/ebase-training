# About this Workshop {.unnumbered}

This course will provide an overview of new techniques to estimate metabolic processes in estuaries using open-source software. We will describe the theory and application of the new Estuarine BAyesian Single-station Estimation (EBASE) method that applies a Bayesian framework to a simple process-based model and dissolved oxygen observations, allowing the estimation of critical metabolic parameters as informed by a set of prior distributions.  We will also compare EBASE to existing models for evaluating metabolism to demonstrate the advantages of the new framework.  Some prior experience with R is expected.  By the end of the course, you will understand how to prepare SWMP data for use with EBASE and to interpret the results to better understand processes that influence ecosystem status and condition. Basic R experience is expected.
