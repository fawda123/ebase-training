We will describe the theory and application of the new Estuarine BAyesian Single-station Estimation (EBASE) method that applies a Bayesian framework to a simple process-based model and dissolved oxygen observations, allowing the estimation of critical metabolic parameters as informed by a set of prior distributions. We will also explore how EBASE and additional R features can be used to evaluate metabolism results and to identify potential drivers of change. By the end of the course, you will understand how to prepare data for use with EBASE and to interpret the results to better understand processes that influence ecosystem status and condition. Basic R experience is expected.\nEBASE materials:",

    "section": "1.3 What is ecosystem metabolism?",
    "text": "1.3 What is ecosystem metabolism?\nSimply put, ecosystem metabolism is a measure of how quickly organic matter is consumed or produced in an aquatic environment. Estuaries are transition zones that receive materials from the land and export them to the ocean and atmosphere. Ecosystem metabolism is a measure of the rate at which this material is processed as a first order property that can affect a wide range of biogeochemical processes.\nMore specifically, ecosystem metabolism is the balance between production and respiration processes that create and consume organic matter. We can use these measures to characterize metabolism in aquatic environments as a rate, as compared to “surrogate” snapshot measures like nutrient or chlorophyll concentrations. It provides a more complete picture of the state of the environment.\nThe simplest expression of metabolism is below:\n\\[\nNEM = P - R\n\\]\nHere, net ecosystem metabolism (\\(NEM\\)) is the difference between gross primary production (\\(P\\)) and respiration (\\(R\\)). Or, net ecosystem metabolism is the difference between processes that produce organic matter and those that consume organic matter. You may also see \\(NEM\\) written as net ecosystem production (\\(NEP\\)).\n\\(NEM\\) can tell us a lot about an ecosystem:\n\nIf positive, the ecosystem is autotrophic, meaning it produces more organic matter than it consumes. Organic matter will accumulate.\nIf negative, the ecosystem is heterotrophic, meaning it consumes more organic matter than it produces. Organic matter will deplete.\n\nAutotrophy and heterotrophy can be governed by many factors. For example, autotrophy may occur more often during warmer months, as temperature can stimulate growth of algae and other primary primary producers. Similarly, hyper-eutrophic systems may be more heterotrophic during the summer as the rapid decomposition of organic matter that was produced by excess nutrients may be increased with temperature. A single pulse of nutrients can create autotrophic conditions as production increases followed by heterotrophic conditions as the new organic material settles to the bottom and is decomposed.\nThis graphic from a synthesis study of 350 sites by Hoellein, Bruesewitz, and Richardson (2013) shows how metabolic ranges vary across different aquatic ecosystems. Here we can see that the largest ranges in production and respiration occur in estuaries and most aquatic systems tend towards heterotrophy. Note the units as grams of oxygen per m\\(^{-2}\\) per day.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the estuarine sites used in Hoellein, Bruesewitz, and Richardson (2013) were from a single study by Caffrey (2004) that evaluated metabolism across all NERR sites. This study was one of the first to develop a system-wide comparison of metabolic rates and several useful conclusions were made.\nFor example, metabolic rates between habitats are shown below, where most sites tend towards heterotrophy, although sites dominated by submerged aquatic vegetation are more balanced.\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrients as drivers of metabolism were also evaluated by Caffrey (2004). Although the relationships were weak, sites with higher nutrient loadings tended towards autotrophy as production was generally higher than respiration.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetabolism is also temporally variable. In addition to seasonal variation, metabolism can be event-driven and respond to external and internal drivers that influence the system. A severe red tide bloom in Tampa Bay occurred in July 2021. The dissolved oxygen time series shows a clear increase and decrease as the bloom developed and then dissipated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe change in ecosystem metabolism from autototrophy to heterotrophy tells a story about the bloom. We see an increase in production followed by an increase in respiration with bloom development and senescence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese quick examples demonstrate that unique information about system dynamics can be inferred from ecosystem metabolism and its components. As you learn to assess metabolism with the the tools from this workshop, you can develop similar hypotheses on factors that control metabolism both within and between systems.",

    "section": "1.4 How is metabolism measured?",
    "text": "1.4 How is metabolism measured?\nMetabolism can be measured several ways, each of which has its own strengths, weaknesses, and assumptions. These include:\n\nBottle-based incubations\nOpen-water techniques\nEcosystem budgets\nUse of oxygen isotopes or inert gases\nAquatic eddy covariance\n\nOpen-water techniques are among the more commonly used approaches applied to continuous monitoring data. These techniques exploit the diel cycle of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration to infer metabolism. The main assumptions are:\n\nProduction produces oxygen during daylight hours\nRespiration consumes oxygen during daylight and nighttime hours\nOxygen exchanges freely with the atmosphere\nThe system is well-mixed\n\n\nThe DO time series can be deconstructed using a mass-balance equation to estimate metabolism. This is a literal deconstruction of the processes in the above figure.\n\\[\nZ\\frac{dC_d}{dt} = P - R + D\n\\]\nThis equation can be translated as the change in dissolved oxygen (\\(dC_d\\)) over time (\\(dt\\)) (a rate) is equal to the difference between production (\\(P\\)) and respiration (\\(R\\)) plus the exchange of oxygen with the atmosphere (\\(D\\)). The units are converted from volumetric (\\(m^{-3}\\)) to areal (\\(m^{-2}\\)) by multiplying the equation by water column depth (\\(Z\\)). In this example, \\(D\\) is positive for ingassing and negative for outgassing.\n\\(P\\), \\(R\\), and \\(D\\) can be estimated several ways depending on which “open-water” technique is used. The most popular method is that of Odum (1956), modified extensively by others since its original presentation. The method calculates the DO flux (DO change per unit time) during day and night periods and corrects it for gas exchange. This is also called the book-keeping method since it’s “simple” arithmetic.\nGas exchange can also be estimated several ways, but the core concept is that the flux in or out of the water is proportional to the difference between the DO saturation concentration (\\(C_s\\)) and the measured concentration in the water (\\(C_d\\)). This difference is also multiplied by a gas exchange coefficient (\\(k\\)), which can vary by wind, temperature, or other factors depending on the model.\n\\[\nD = k(C_s - C_d)\n\\]\nFortunately for us, there are existing packages in R that can estimate these parameters. One is the WtRegDO package that uses the Odum technique, which was covered in a workshop a few years ago. Another is EBASE, which we’ll discuss today. EBASE follows the same general principles as the Odum technique, but differs in the statistical method to estimate the parameter (i.e., Bayesian) and the model used for each parameter.\nWe’ll talk more about how EBASE estimates metabolism in Lesson 3, but first we need to get setup with R and prepare our data in Lesson 2.",
