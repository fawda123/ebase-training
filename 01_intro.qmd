# Inroduction

## Lesson Outline

This lesson will cover the very basics of ecosystem metabolism: what it is, why you should care about it, and what it can tell you.  We'll also make sure that RStudio is setup for the rest of the workshop.

## Learning Goals

- Learn a basic definition of metabolism
- Understand what it tells you about your ecosystem
- Understand how it is measured
- Setup RStudio for the workshop using a project

## Next steps
 
In this lesson we learned the basics about metabolism and made sure RStudio is ready to go for the rest of the workshop. Next weâ€™ll learn how to import and prepare data with SWMPr for analysis with EBASE.
