# Setup for the workshop {#setup}

Thanks for your interest in the ecosystem metabolism workshop. You will need to do the following, outlined below, before the workshop. 

1. [Install R](#sec-instr)
1. [Install RStudio](#sec-instrstudio)
1. [Install JAGS](#sec-instjags)
1. [Install R packages](#sec-instpackages)
1. [Posit Cloud](#sec-cloud) (optional)

Most of these steps will require administrative privileges on a computer.  Work with your IT staff to complete the setup if you do not have these privileges.  As an alternative, you can use Posit Cloud to participate (see @sec-cloud), although we strongly encourage you to install the software on your personal computer for use after the workshop.

__Please reach out if you have any issues with installation: [mbeck@tbep.org](mailto:mbeck@tbep.org)__

## Install R and RStudio 

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing software. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. *You need to install R before you install RStudio*.

Thanks to the [USGS-R Training group](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training.html){target="_blank"} and [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html){target="_blank"} for making their installation materials available. The following instructions come directly from their materials, with a few minor edits to help you get set up.

### Windows: Download and install R {#sec-instr}

Go to [CRAN and download](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/){target="_blank"} the R installer for Windows. Make sure to choose the latest stable version (v4.4.1 as of August 2024).

Once the installer downloads, Right-click on it and select "Run as administrator".

Type in your credentials and click yes (or if you don't have administrator access have your IT rep install with Admin privileges).

You can click next through the standard dialogs and accept most defaults. But at the destination screen, please verify that it is installing it to C:\\Program Files\\R

![](figs/install_destination.png)

At the "Select Components" screen, you can accept the default and install both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

At this screen, uncheck 'Create a desktop icon' because non-admin users in Windows will be unable to delete it.

### Windows: Download and install RStudio {#sec-instrstudio}

Download RStudio from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download){target="_blank"}.

After download, double-click the installer. It will ask for your administrator credentials to install (you might need to have your IT rep install again).

Accept all the default options for the RStudio install.

### macOS: Download and install R

-   Download and install R from the CRAN website for Mac [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/){target="_blank"}.
-   Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version
-   Double click on the downloaded file to install R
-   It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/){target="_blank"} (needed by some packages)

### macOS: Download and install RStudio

-   Go to the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download){target="_blank"} download page
-   Under Installers select the appropriate RStudio download file for macOS
-   Double click the file to install RStudio

### Check Install

Once installed, RStudio should be accessible from the start menu. Start up RStudio. Once running it should look something like this:

## Install JAGS {#sec-instjags}

The JAGS software is a separate open-source program for analyzing Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.  It is used by EBASE to run the Bayesian models. Follow the instructions [here](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/) to download and install the version appropriate for your operating system.

## Install R packages {#sec-instpackages}

We'll use the following R packages during the workshop.  Install them in the RStudio console by running these commands:

```r
install.packages('EBASE')
install.packages('SWMPr')
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

After installation, check the packages can be loaded without error:

```r
library(EBASE)
library(SWMPr)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Posit Cloud (optional) {#sec-cloud}

Posit Cloud provides an environment to use RStudio and the resources above through a web browser.  We've created a workspace on Posit Cloud that includes most all of the software and packages described above. __Please only use this option as a last resort.  We strongly encourage installing the software on your own computer.__  

Open the following URL in a web browser: [https://posit.cloud/content/8518890](https://posit.cloud/content/8518890){target="_blank"}

You will see a login screen that looks like this: 

![](figs/positsignup.png)

Sign up using a personal login or existing account (Google, GitHub, etc.).

You'll see the workspace in your browser once you've signed in.  You'll need to make a permanent copy to save your work.  Just click the button at the top marked "+ Save as Permanent Copy".  When this is done, the red text at the top indicating "TEMPORARY COPY" will no longer be visible.

Now you can follow along with the workshop content.
