## Lesson Outline

This lesson will cover the very basics of using R and RStudio on your computer.  R is a powerful open-source programming language that is widely used for data analysis and visualization.  RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easier to work with R.  Combined, they provide a powerful tool for working with data.

## Learning Goals

- Understand the basics of R and RStudio
- Learn how to use RStudio to write and run R code
- Learn how to install and load packages in R
- Understand the basic data structures in R
- Learn how to read data into R

## Next steps
 
In this lesson we learned about R and Rstudio, some of the basic syntax and data structures in R, and how to import files. We’ve also imported some water quality files from Apalachicola Bay. Next we’ll learn how to import these data with SWMPr and prepare the data for analysis with EBASE.
